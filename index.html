<p>Static buffer overflow detection technique tends to report too many false positives fundamentally due to the lack 
of software execution information. Currently, static warnings can only be validated by manual inspection. 
We propose BovInspector, the first framework for automatic static buffer overflow warnings inspection 
and valid bugs repair. Given the program source code, BovInspector first performs warning reachability analysis. 
Then, BovInspector executes the source code symbolically under the guidance of reachable warnings. 
Each reachable warning is validated and classified by checking whether all the path conditions and the buffer 
overflow constraints can be satisfied simultaneously. For each validated true warning, BovInspector fix it
 by adding boundary checking or replacing unsafe APIs by safe ones. BovInspector is complementary to prior 
static buffer overflow discovery schemes. Experimental results on real open source programs show that 
BovInspector can identify from 25% to 100% of the false warnings with an average of 59.9%.</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BovInspector/project/gh-pages/images/overview.png"  alt="overview" width="250" height="355"/>
<p>BovInspector has
two inputs, the static buffer overflow vulnerability warnings
and the source code, and three outputs, true warnings, false
warnings, and undecided warnings. True warnings are those
that there exists at least one test case that triggers buffer over-
flow. For each true warning, BovInspector also outputs such a
test case. In addition, BovInspector can automatically repair
the vulnerabilities for validated true warnings by checking
array boundaries or replacing unsafe API by safe ones. False
warnings are those that there exists no test case that triggers
buffer overflow or totally unreachable. For such warnings, no
human inspection is needed. Undecidable warnings are those
that BovInspector can neither find a test case to trigger buffer
overflow nor prove that no such test case exists within a
given time limit. The optimization goal of BovInspector is to
minimize the number of undecided warnings. Ideally, we want
to minimize the number of undecidable warnings to zero for all
programs; however, this is theoretically impossible because of
the problem of using one program to find non-trivial properties
of another program is fundamentally undecided.</p>

<a id="tool" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tool</h3>

<p>We implemented BovInspector on <a href="http://klee.github.io/">KLEE</a>, a state-of-the-art symbolic execution engine built on top of the <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM compiler
infrastructure</a>. We extended functions of klee from two directions: guided symbolic execution and buffer overflow validation.The static buffer overflow detector used in our experiments is HP Fortify version 3.2.
We used <a href="https://github.com/BovInspector/project/blob/master/bin/fvdlParser.rar">fvdlParser</a> to convert the results of Fortify into static buffer overflow warning.
We uesd <a href="https://github.com/BovInspector/project/blob/master/bin/buildCFG.rar">buildCFG.so</a> which is complied by LLVM pass to build CFG ,analyse reachablity in the graph and get warning path set.
We modified source code of klee to inspect buffer overflow warnings.With the position of buffer overflow in the 
source code, we used <a href="https://github.com/BovInspector/project/blob/master/src/repair buffer overflow/repair.py">repair.py</a> to repair the vulnerability.You can download the source code from <a href="https://github.com/BovInspector/project">here</a>.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experiment</h3>

<p>All experiments were conducted on a quad-core machine
with an Intel Core (TM) Corei5-2400 3.10GHz processor and
4G memory, running Linux 3.11.0.To evaluate our method, we designed two sets of experiments. The first set of experiments
is designed to evaluate the correctness and accuracy of our method. The second set of experiments is designed to check
the scalability and effectiveness of our method for real-world open source programs. Through these experiments, we hope to
answer the following key research questions: (1) How much effort can a developer save by validating buffer overflow warnings
using our technique(2) How does our technique perform on large-scale, real-world applications (3) How efficient is our
technique.</p>
