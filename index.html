<p>Static buffer overflow detection technique tends to report too many false positives fundamentally due to the lack 
of software execution information. Currently, static warnings can only be validated by manual inspection. 
We propose BovInspector, the first framework for automatic static buffer overflow warnings inspection 
and valid bugs repair. Given the program source code, BovInspector first performs warning reachability analysis. 
Then, BovInspector executes the source code symbolically under the guidance of reachable warnings. 
Each reachable warning is validated and classified by checking whether all the path conditions and the buffer 
overflow constraints can be satisfied simultaneously. For each validated true warning, BovInspector fix it
 by adding boundary checking or replacing unsafe APIs by safe ones. BovInspector is complementary to prior 
static buffer overflow discovery schemes. Experimental results on real open source programs show that 
BovInspector can identify from 25% to 100% of the false warnings with an average of 59.9%.</p>

<a id="tool" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tool</h3>

<p>We implemented BovInspector on <a href="http://klee.github.io/">KLEE</a>, a state-of-the-art symbolic execution engine built on top of the <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM compiler
infrastructure</a>. The static buffer overflow detector used in our experiments is HP Fortify version 3.2.
We used <a href="https://github.com/BovInspector/project/blob/master/bin/fvdlParser.rar">fvdlParser</a> to convert the results of Fortify into static buffer overflow warning.
We uesd <a href="https://github.com/BovInspector/project/blob/master/bin/buildCFG.rar">buildCFG.so</a> which is a LLVM pass to build CFG ,analyse reachablity in the graph and get warning path set.
We modified source code of <a href="https://github.com/BovInspector/project/blob/master/bin/klee.rar">klee</a> to inspect buffer overflow warnings.With the position of buffer overflow in the 
source code, we used <a href="https://github.com/BovInspector/project/blob/master/src/repair buffer overflow/repair.py">repair.py</a> to repair the vulnerability.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experiment</h3>

<p>To evaluate our method, we designed two sets of experiments. The first set of experiments
is designed to evaluate the correctness and accuracy of our method. The second set of experiments is designed to check
the scalability and effectiveness of our method for real-world open source programs. Through these experiments, we hope to
answer the following key research questions: (1) How much effort can a developer save by validating buffer overflow warnings
using our technique(2) How does our technique perform on large-scale, real-world applications (3) How efficient is our
technique.</p>
