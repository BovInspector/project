// Due to the excessive polymorphism used here you can loose track very easily
// which methods are SUPPOSED to be customised and which are base class methods
// you should not override. Although a missing 'virtual' modificator is already
// a very good hint to decide this we want to make things abundantly clear by
// adding the 'final' keyword. Additionally, functions you can customise are
// typically prefixed by a single underscore (_). Since 'final' is not part of
// the C++ language we introduce /*final*/, to indicate methods you
// should not reimplement. Note that there is no check at all to make sure you
// do not violate this guideline. This solution is inspired by
// http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/strange-inheritance.html#faq-23.12
